# Household Energy Consumption Analysis

### Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on household energy consumption data collected over almost 4 years. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into energy usage behavior. Insights from this analysis can inform energy management strategies and conservation efforts.

### Dataset
* Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
* Features: ``Date``, ``Time``, ``Global_active_power``, ``Global_reactive_power``, ``Voltage``, ``Global_intensity``, ``Sub_metering_1``, ``Sub_metering_2``, ``Sub_metering_3``

### Project Steps
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: Load the dataset, inspect its structure, and check for missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, check for inconsistencies, and convert data types if necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as day of the week, month, and season.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze energy consumption patterns by hour, day of the week, month, and season.

### Key Findings
* Peak energy consumption periods
* Seasonal variations in energy usage
* Relationship between energy consumption and external factors

### Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into household energy consumption patterns, which can be used to optimize energy usage and promote energy conservation.
